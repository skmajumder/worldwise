# WorldWise

This is an React project that allows users to select a city they have visited and take notes about their trip. The project uses a real-time map and UI state management to enhance the user experience. In this project I use React, React Router, json-server, context API, memo, useMemo, useCallback, hooks, Reducer.

> [!NOTE]
> This is an ongoing react project.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js - Make sure to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), which includes NPM. NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime environment. The NPM â€“ Node Package Manager is the default package manager for NodeJs.

> [!TIP]
> Use the following steps on your computer's terminal to check if Node js is installed or whether it is installed correctly

#### For windows

1. Open terminal.
1. Run this command to check if Node is installed or not

```
node -v
```

1. Now run this command to check if NPM is installed

```
npm -v
```

#### For macOS

1. Open your terminal
1. To check in node.js is installed, run

## 3. Run the project

After installing the dependencies, you need to follow some steps to run the project.

#### 1. Run the JSON Server.

[Json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) is a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds. In **_data_** folder/directory it has a source file **_cities.json_** for the json server. Now need to run the JSON Server. To run the JSON Server run the following command.

```
npm run server
```

After successfully running the JSON Server you will get a URL something like this: **_http://localhost:8000/cities_**.

#### 2. Run the project

Now you can run the project on development mode. For that you will need to run the following command.

```
npm run dev
```

After successfully running the command you will get a URL like this: **_http://localhost:5173_** URL can be different on the different machine. Copy and paste the following URL into your browser.

> Run the project on production mode (Optional)

You can also run the project on production with the following command.
